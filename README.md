# Playing The World

When we talk about emergent behaviors, we often default to thinking about them through the lens of code: the glitchy, weird, poetic, delightful, and unexpected outputs of a digital algorithmic system. But as we play with delightful and unpredictable rulesets in code, it is worth stepping back and exploring the rulesets humans have been making to surprise, delight, and connect with each other for millenia: that is, games.

In this session, we will explore what game design and play studies can bring to our practices of poetic computation and design. How do we play in and around rulesets, both in the magic circle of games as well as our daily lives? What does it mean to design a game for a special someone, a special space, or a special circumstance? What unique mechanics can we draw from our own life experiences? What does it mean for us to play well together? What new relationships can play foster? How can we use rules, play, and games to create momentary glimpses of the futures we want to share? How might those benefits ripple out after the game has ended? 

We’ll use game design techniques to create experiences that tap into shared joy and connection. We’ll also pull in readings from artists and activists thinking about the politics of play, joy, and pleasure, and what those experiences can bring to the world and our relationships. 

Sessions will be split between guided lecture time, design/prototyping time, and playtime. Students will be prompted to make personalized analog games for each other, multiplayer games for public spaces in their community, and more. Students will finish the session by forming groups and creating a small game by and for the local community, which will be documented and distributed in zine format.

## Tools and materials
_No coding experience is required._ We will be playing some digital reference games, so please bring a computer if you have one, but computer access is not required. Game design exercises will be done with analog tools (paper, pens, markers, index cards, string, anything else students would like to bring in to work with), although students are welcome to make digital projects if they like.

## Concepts we'll talk about':
* How game designers have understood ‘play’ and ‘games’ through history
* How artists have used play and rule-sets in their work throughout history, especially conceptual/avant garde art (e.g. Yoko Ono, John Cage, Sol Lewitt) and relational art (e.g. Nicolas Bourriaud, Rirkrit Tiravanija)
* The social effects of “playing well” together, the concept of “coliberation,” and how to recognize and design experiences that tap into that feeling
* How we can design mechanics based on our personal experiences to make funny, relatable, and/or cathartic experiences for each other
* How activists use play in their non-games practices to bring people together, avoid burnout, and point to alternative worlds
